Dependent variable= Target variable= need to be found

Independent variable= predictor variable= is used

properties

1.Intercept:
   ->This is the value of the dependent variable when all the
   independent variables are zero.
   ->if you're modeling house prices based on size and location, the intercept might represent the average price of a house if both size and location are zero (which isn't possible, but helps interpret the model).

2.Rank of matrix X:
This indicates the number of linearly independent columns in the data matrix X, which includes your independent variables
